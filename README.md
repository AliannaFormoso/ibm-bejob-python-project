## üéì Project: Create and print a squared matrix

### ‚úç Instructions

1. Write a Python program that generates an (NxN) matrix and fill it with random numbers between 0-9.
2. The program must print the matrix and then calculate the sum of each row and column.
3. General specifications
   - Matrix generation:
     - The program must generate a squared matrix, sized NxN, where N is the integer number provided by the user.
   - Fill the matrix with random numbers:
     - The program must fill the matrix with random numbers between 0 and 9.
   - Print the matrix:
     - The program should print the generated matrix on the screen.
   - Calculate the sum of each row and column:
     - The program should calculate the sum of the elements of each row and column and store them in two lists.
   - Print the sum of each row and column:
      - The program should print the sum of each row and column on the screen.

*Additionally, it is suggested that the program includes exception handling in case the user enters an invalid value for N. It should also include comments to explain the code, and finally, it should perform the necessary unit tests to ensure that the result is as expected.*

### üö∂üèº Getting Started

There are two ways you can work locally.
To get the repository you can either:

- Download the project from GitHub by clicking on the green button and selecting download.
- Forking the repository and then clone it to your local machine (see info on forking in the GitHub documentation: [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### [Optional] Forking and Cloning

To fork the repository, click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. Once forked, view the repository under your repositories. Clone the your repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone path/to/your/GitHub/repository
```

#### Accessing the Working Directory

Then, you will need to change your working directory to the project's directory folder in this repo - all the scripts, should run within the directory. In the terminal window, type `cd folder-name` and hit [**enter**].

#### Running the program

Once there, got to the terminal and run it (make sure you have the python extension to do it), enter the desired size for the squared matrix and the magic will happen.
You also can run the tests by the same way.
